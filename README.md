# douban-tools

This project includes some scripts for personal usage with [douban](https://www.douban.com/).

## File list

- backup-douban.py : backup douban statuses(广播). Only support statuses in this version.
- *cacert.pem* : CA certificates extracted from Mozilla. Copied from [cURL website](https://curl.haxx.se/docs/caextract.html).
- *douban-cookies.txt* : an example empty cookie file. Export your own cookie file using Firefox add-on `Advanced Cookie Manager` or something like this.
- parse-statuses.py : parse and reformat douban statuses generated by `backup-douban.py`.

## License & Advice

The *cacert.pem* is extracted from Mozilla and licensed under the same license as the Mozilla source file: MPL 2.0

The other python scripts are placed in public domain. You can read, change, and use them in any way. However, it is **not** advised to use `backup-douban.py` on too many douban web-pages too frequently since this would increase the burden of douban.
